<p>Special days, usually known as festivals, are very common in our life and we&rsquo;ve been involved in them nearly all the time. However, I think it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to them.</p>
<p>It was just the last day of my term-ending exam that I heard something unacceptable. Hair cutting isn&rsquo;t allowed in Lunar January due local customs.

<p>There are still something more meaningful to do than being involved in a special day.
